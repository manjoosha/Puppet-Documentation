            Introduction to Puppet
            
•	What is Puppet?
Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.

	Who made puppet and who supports it?
Puppet is made by Luke Kanies. It is based on ruby language. Currently puppet is supported by Puppet Labs.

	What are the advantages of Puppet?
Normally most of the configuration management tool, deploy the required configuration on a machine, and leave them as it is. But puppet keeps on verifying the configuration at a specified interval (which you can modify as per requirement).
Puppet is used by major players in the industry like Google, red hat etc. Wide number of platforms are supported in puppet.

	System Components?
Puppet is typically used in a client/server formation, with all of your clients talking to one or more central servers. 
Each client contacts the server periodically (every half hour, by default), downloads the latest configuration, and makes sure it is in sync with that configuration.
Once done, the client can send a report back to the server indicating if anything needed to change.
